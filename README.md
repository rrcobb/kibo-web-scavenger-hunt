# Kibo Web Scavenger Hunt

Use the devtools to find secret messages hidden in the webpage.

- Follow all the prompts
- Enter the secret message into an input to reveal the next prompt

There are 6 challenges in total.

## Feedback / TODO

- Add note that mobile will not work
    - Eventually, create and link to a repl version where mobile will work
- show indicator that a step is complete (check mark)
- Flaky devtools opening detection, and help item not helpful enough if the link
    doesn't show

## Getting started

It's vanilla html, css, and js. Open `index.html` in the browser.

If you are seeing font preload warnings, you can use a simple http 
fileserver like `python -m http.server 8080` or `npx serve`.
