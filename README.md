# Kibo Web Scavenger Hunt

Using the chrome inspector + dev console to find some secret messages

- Enter the hidden message into an input to reveal the next prompt
- Follow all the prompts / find the password to gain entry into the course

## Feedback / TODO

TODO:
- remind that mobile will not work
- Summary / Details for Help Panel
    - Link to DevTools Video
    - Link to Solution Video
    - Devtools is open, what do I do next?
    - I'm stuck, give me a hint!

MAYBE link to repl version where mobile will work?

- TODO: congrats at the end should scroll into view
- feeling stuck feels bad
    - TODO: add 'I'm stuck, give me a hint' button
    - TODO: words of encouragement / congrats on guessing right
        - "Keep going, the next one is tricky"
    - TODO: connect to the conceptual ideas in the success messages
        - Text Nodes
        - HTML elements and tags
        - HTML attributes
        - CSS properties and values
        - Changing CSS values
        - (some js thing? the console?)


TODO: bugfixes
- bug when the devtools have the ‘mobile’ turned on, todo: check whether that’s the default
- clicking the links to continue isn’t super obvious (maybe buttons would be better? maybe it’s okay? not 100%)
- it’s still not totally clear what #3 is asking for. Maybe it’ll make sense in the context of the lesson? not sure

## Secret Message

Final result:
- Climb Kibo
- you must build
- strong
- foundations
- to reach
- the peak
