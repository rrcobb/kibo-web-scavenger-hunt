# Kibo Web Scavenger Hunt

Using the chrome inspector + dev console to find some secret messages

- Enter the hidden message into an input to reveal the next prompt
- Follow all the prompts / find the password to gain entry into the course

## Feedback / TODO

TODO: remind that mobile will not work
MAYBE link to repl version where mobile will work?

specific challenge feedback:

1. kinda boring, did not learn anything
2. weird language because it describes the devtools, instead move that
   description to the intro
3. needs the context of what an HTML element is
4. "inside this very prompt" is not quite clear enough
5. too hard, it's unclear how to select an element, where the h1 is,
    and what the Styles tab is
6. not clear what to change it to

TODO: change the first task to use the developer tools

- feeling stuck feels bad
    - TODO: add 'I'm stuck, give me a hint' button
    - TODO: words of encouragement / congrats on guessing right
    - Keep going, the next one is tricky
    - TODO: connect to the conceptual ideas in the success messages
        - Text Nodes
        - HTML elements and tags
        - HTML attributes
        - CSS properties and values
        - Changing CSS values
        - (some js thing? the console?)

- TODO: congrats at the end should scroll into view
- additional challenges:
    - maybe: change the bg color of the page, making a message visible
    - TODO Make this number 5, shift the previous ones earlier, but leave number 6 in place

TODO: bugfixes
- bug when the devtools have the ‘mobile’ turned on, todo: check whether that’s the default
- clicking the links to continue isn’t super obvious (maybe buttons would be better? maybe it’s okay? not 100%)
- it’s still not totally clear what #3 is asking for. Maybe it’ll make sense in the context of the lesson? not sure

## Secret Message

Final result:
- Climb Kibo
- you must build
- strong
- foundations
- to reach
- the peak
