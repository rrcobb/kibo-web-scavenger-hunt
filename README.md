# Kibo Web Scavenger Hunt

Using the chrome inspector + dev console to find some secret messages

- Enter the hidden message into an input to reveal the next prompt
- Follow all the prompts / find the password to gain entry into the course

## Feedback / TODO

specific challenge feedback:

1. kinda boring, did not learn anything
2. weird language because it describes the devtools, instead move that
   description to the intro
3. needs the context of what an HTML element is
4. "inside this very prompt" is not quite clear enough
5. too hard, it's unclear how to select an element, where the h1 is,
    and what the Styles tab is
6. not clear what to change it to

TODO: change the first task to use the developer tools

DONE: The motivation / context is weak
    - Intro could say what you'll learn from the scavenger hunt
    - explain why you're here
    - it's to learn to use the developer tools to inspect and change things on
        a webpage

- feeling stuck feels bad
    - TODO: add 'I'm stuck, give me a hint' button
    - TODO: words of encouragement / congrats on guessing right
    - Keep going, the next one is tricky
    - TODO: connect to the conceptual ideas in the success messages
        - Text Nodes
        - HTML elements and tags
        - HTML attributes
        - CSS properties and values
        - Changing CSS values
        - (some js thing? the console?)

- TODO: congrats at the end should scroll into view
- additional challenges:
    - maybe: change the bg color of the page and making the background color -
    - TODO Make this number 5, shift the previous ones earlier, but leave number 6 in place

## Secret Message

Final result:
- climb kibo
- You must build
- strong
- foundations
- to reach
- the peak
