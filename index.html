    <h1>DevTools Scavenger Hunt</h1>
    <div class="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The DevTools are like a Detective's magnifying glass, notebook, and
      recorder all in one. Web Developers use the DevTools every day to look
      'under the hood' of a webpage, see what's going on, and make experimental
      changes.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this challenge, you'll use the DevTools to find messages hidden in the
      HTML and CSS of this page.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="devtools">
      <h2>The DevTools</h2>
      <div><p>This page contains hidden messages. Follow the clues to put the pieces
        together.</p>
        <p>You'll need to use the <strong>developer tools</strong> to find each
        message.</p>
        <p>
        Open the developer tools by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting 'inspect' from the menu. You should see a panel open at the bottom or side of the page.</p>
        <p>When you have the Developer Tools open, you'll see a ton of buttons
        and information.</p>
        <p>
        <a href="#" id="start-tour">
          The DevTools are open, let's take a tour.</a>

        <div class="tour">
          <p>The <strong>Elements panel</strong> shows the HTML elements that make
          up the page. You can see what's inside an element by clicking
          open the arrow on the left.</p>
          <img src="./images/elements-panel.png" />

          <p> The <strong>Styles panel</strong> shows the CSS styles for an
          element. Click on an element in the Elements panel and look in the
          Styles panel to see all of the styles.</p>
          <img src="./images/styles-panel.png" />

          <p>The Styles panel has a bonus power: you can click on the value for any
          property and change it! You can change the color of the text, or the
          font size, or the background color, or any other CSS property.</p>

          <a id="show-instructions" href="#">Got it. What's next?</a>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
        You'll use the Elements panel to find HTML elements and inspect their 
        attributes. You'll use the Styles panel to see
        CSS properties. By the end of the challenge, you'll make changes to the
        styles of the page in order to reveal the most deeply hidden messages.
        </p>

        <p>Click the button below to get started. For each prompt:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Read the clue and use the DevTools to find the answer.</li>
          <li>Type the answer in the box.</li>
          <li>Click "Check" to check your answer and get the next prompt.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can check as many times as you want. You'll get feedback on whether your answer was right or wrong.</p>
        <p>After you solve all the challenges, you'll uncover the <strong>final answer.</strong></p>
        <div class="start">
          <button>Okay, let's start!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="prompt --1">
      <p>1. The first secret message is: <strong
                                             class="secret">Climb Kibo</strong>. Type it into the box below.</p>
      <p><small>This one's pretty easy. It's supposed to get you warmed up for
        solving the next few challenges.</small></p>
    </div>

    <div class="prompt --2">
      2. To find the second secret message, find the page <strong>title</strong>
      in the Elements panel. The title tag has the secret in it!

      In the Elements tab of the panel, click to open the <strong>head</strong> tag,
      and look for the <strong>title</strong> tag. The title is inside the head.
    </div>

    <div class="prompt --3">
      <!-- find an html element -->
      3. The third secret is the name of <strong>this HTML element</strong>.
      Right click on the bold text and click 'inspect'. The text 'this HTML
      element' is inside of a <strong>tag</strong>. The tag has angle brackets (&lt; and
      &gt;) and a name. That name is the third secret.
    </div>

    <div class="prompt --4">
      <!-- find an html attribute -->
      4. The fourth secret is the <strong>value</strong> of an input element hidden inside this
      very prompt. Find an <strong>input</strong> element in this prompt, and look for
      the <strong>value</strong> attribute.
      <input type="hidden" value="foundations" />
    </div>

    <div class="prompt --5">
      <!-- find a CSS property -->
      5. The fifth secret will be in the Styles panel. First,
      select the <strong>h1</strong> element - it's the heading of the page. The
      <strong>Styles</strong> section of the developer tools panel shows the CSS properties and values for this element.
      The secret is the value for the <strong>content</strong> property for the
      <strong>h1</strong>. 
    </div>

    <div class="prompt --6">
      <!-- find a message hidden offscreen -->
      6. To find the last value, you'll have to make a change to the page using
      the developer tools. There's an image that's positioned off screen. Click
      on that element in the Elements tab to select it. In the Styles tab,
      change the value for the 'left' property to move the element
      so that it's visible. 
      <p></p>
      On the image, you'll see the last secret message.
    </div>

    <div class="checker">

      <input type="text" id="secret"></input>
      <button class="check">Check</button>
